# Sorting algorithm

- get a list of unsorted numbers
  - get them from user input
    - make sure they are valid numbers
    - make sure the list is more than 1
- loop through a list of numbers
  - order numbers one by one
- print / ouput / return the results

DETERMINISTIC

```c#
// NON-Deterministic - could get different results for different inputs
List<int> GetListFromUser()
{
  // get multiple numbers from user
  // check for validity
}

List<int> SortFunction(List<int> inputList)
{
  // for loop and nested for loop
  // order numbers one by one 
}

void PrintFunction(List<int> inputList)
{
  // output numbers one by one to the console
}

```

Char vs Int

Ascii value

key length: 2
message length: 4

message: abcd
key: bc

output: bd

messageIndex % key.Length
3 % 2 = 1
